In this assignmnet I made a Search Dashboard with Debounce & Throttle and making this was pretty challenging as this was the first assignment where I had to implement back to top button but somehow I managed to complete it and with responsiveness and all the functionalities.

The main challenge was the array of names took me more than an hour just to find and make them string and put them inside an array ,I think it took me more than 90 minutes.

Added two counters first to display the count of keystroke in the searchbar or the character counter of search bar and the second counter for the count of matching names. Implemented both successfully with responsiveness .
