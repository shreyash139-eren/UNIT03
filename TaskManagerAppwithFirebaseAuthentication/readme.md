1.Project description:-

    A fully functional Task management application with responsive layout with some functionalities like soting on completion status, completed task counter with the feature of editing and deleting tasks.


    2.Setup instructions:-

        Started with the registration and login page added aithentication and authorization using firebase.

        Then moved to dashboard, worked on the nav bar first, then added the add task feature with responsiveness, after which added edit and remove functions for every task added and lastly added filter and counter function.


    3.Any challenges faced and how I overcame them:-

        While making this app, I got stuck at many functions like showing the completed tasks counter as it should be updated when checkbox  is checked and I did it a long time ago so I had to give it more than an hour just to make it functional and targetting all checkboxes was one of my main problem.
